function [X_poly] = polyFeatures(X, p)
% [X_poly] = polyFeatures(X, p) takes a data matrix X (size m x 1) and
% maps each example into its polynomial features where
% X_poly(i, :) = [X(i) X(i).^2 X(i).^3 ...  X(i).^p];

% Initialize values
X_poly = zeros(numel(X), p);

% Return a matrix X_poly where the p-th column of X contains the 
% values of X to the p-th power

X_poly(:, 1) = X;
for i = 2:p
    X_poly(:, i) = X.^i;
end
end

% Note: there are polynomial terms, but still using linear regression 
%       model to optimize learning; therefore, need to scale with 
%       featureNormalize.m.

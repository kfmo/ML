function x = emailFeatures(word_indices)
% x = emailFeatures(word_indices) takes in a word_indices vector and 
% produces a feature vector from the word indices. 

% Initialize values
x = zeros(n, 1);
n = 1899; % total number of words in the dictionary

% Return a feature vector for the given email (word_indices). To help 
% make it easier to process the emails, you should have already 
% pre-processed each email and converted each word in the email into an 
% index in a fixed dictionary (of 1899 words in this example). The variable
% word_indices contains the list of indices of the words which occur in one email.
% 
% Example, if you have the text:
%    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
% Then, the word_indices vector for this text might look like:
%    60  100   33   44   10   53  60  58   5
% where, we have mapped each word onto a number, for example:
%    the   -- 60
%    quick -- 100
%    ...
% (note: the above numbers are just an example and are not the actual mappings)
%
% The binary feature vector should indicate whether a particular word occurs in
% the email. That is, x(i) = 1 when word i is present in the email. Concretely, 
% if the word 'the' (say, index 60) appears in the email, then x(60) = 1.
% The feature vector should look like:
%    x = [ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... 0 0 0 0 1 ... 0 0 0 1 0 ..];

x(word_indices) = 1;

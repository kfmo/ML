function p = predictOneVsAll(all_beta, X)
%  p = predictOneVsAll(all_beta, X) will return a vector of predictions
%  for each example in the matrix X. Note that X contains the examples in
%  rows. all_beta is a matrix where the i-th row is a trained logistic
%  regression beta vector for the i-th class. P should be set to a vector
%  of values from 1..K, where K = size(all_beta, 1). (e.g., p = [1; 3; 1; 2] 
%  predicts classes 1, 3, 1, 2 for 4 examples) 

% Initialize values
m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(all_beta, 1);
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

% Add ones to the X data matrix for index bias
X = [ones(m, 1) X];

% Make predictions using the learned one-vs-all logistic regression parameters
%   Set p to a vector of predictions from 1 to num_labels

A = sigmoid(X*all_beta');

[c,i] = max(A, [], 2);
p = i;

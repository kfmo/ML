function X_rec = recoverData(Z, U, K)
% X_rec = recoverData(Z, U, K) recovers an approximation the 
% original data that has been reduced to K dimensions. It returns the
% approximate reconstruction in X_rec.

% Initialize values
X_rec = zeros(size(Z, 1), size(U, 1));

% Compute the approximation of the data by projecting back
% onto the original space using the top K eigenvectors in U.

X_rec = Z * U(:, 1:K)';

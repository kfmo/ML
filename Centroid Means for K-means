function centroids = centroidMeans(X, idx, K)
% centroids = centroidMeans(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
% computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
% given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
% idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
% example, and K, the number of centroids. 

% Initialize values
[m n] = size(X);
centroids = zeros(K, n);

% Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
% belong to it

for mu_i = 1:K
    centroids(mu_i, :) = sum(X(idx == mu_i, :)) / sum(idx == mu_i);

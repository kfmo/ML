function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = FeatNorm(X)
% Normalize the features in X 
% FeatNorm(X) returns a normalized X, X_norm, where
% the mean value, mu, of each feature is 0 and the standard 
% deviation, sigma, is 1. This is often a good preprocessing 
% step when working with learning algorithms.

% Initialize values
X_norm = X;
mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
m = size(X, 2);

% First, compute the mean of each feature dimension, subtract 
% it from the dataset, and store it in mu. Next, compute the
% standard deviation of each feature, divide each feature by 
% its standard deviation, and store the standard deviation in 
% sigma. 
%
% X is a matrix where each column is a feature and each row is 
% an example. Perform the normalization separately for each
% feature. 
     
for i = 1:m
    mu(i) = mean(X(:,i));
    sigma(i) = std(X(:,i));
    X_norm(:,i) = (X(:,i)- mu(i)) / sigma(i);
